# The Following Repository / Associated Code is Connected to the Kaggle Competition

The Repository will only contain my notebook as the associated data will be excess and unnecessary load.

If you would like to download the data yourself, [please follow the link to the Kaggle Page]() where you can use either the API
or the download links to download for yourselves

I will likely have a single notebook which is completed as well as timed re-runs as I would like to improve my timed case-study performance.

Follow along on my twitch during the daytime if you want to see me try and tackle the timed case-studies for 1-2 hours.
